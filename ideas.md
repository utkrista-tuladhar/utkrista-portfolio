- Project cards with hover-reveal descriptions
- Timeline visualization for experience

**Interaction Philosophy:**
- Smooth fade-in animations on scroll
- Hover states that subtly shift or expand elements
- Click-to-reveal project details

- Hover effects: scale (1.02) + shadow depth increase
- Scroll-triggered animations for timeline and skill bars
- Smooth transitions on all interactive elements (200-300ms)

**Typography System:**
- Display: Poppins Bold (700) for headings
